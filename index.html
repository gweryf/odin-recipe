            A cuisine is a style of cooking characterized by distinctive ingredients, techniques and dishes, and usually associated with a specific culture or geographic region. Regional food preparation techniques, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a region. A cuisine is partly determined by ingredients that are available locally or through trade. Often particular regional varieties of ingredients are developed and contribute to the cuisine, such as Japanese rice in Japanese cuisine and New Mexico chile in New Mexican cuisine. Religious food laws can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine, such as Hinduism in Indian cuisine, Sikhism in Punjabi cuisine, Buddhism in East Asian cuisine, Islam in Middle Eastern cuisine, and Judaism in Jewish and Israeli cuisine.
